## Using the Content

Content is located in the `content/` folder.
It currently consists of 5 chapters:

* [Software Stack](content/chapters/software-stack/)
* [Data](content/chapters/data/)
* [Compute](content/chapters/compute/)
* [Input/Output](content/chapters/io/)
* [Application Interaction](content/chapters/app-interact/)

Each chapter has its own folder.
Content for each chapter is split in two subfolders:

* `lecture/`: content to be presented and discussed as part of lectures
* `lab/`: content to be worked on as practical activities during labs / seminars

Lecture content is expected to be presented and followed.
Lab content is expected to be used as practice work.

## Chapter Contents

Lecture content consists of slides and demos.
Slides are written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and use [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to render HTML output.
Lecture slides are built from the `slides.md` file using the `make` command (and the `Makefile`).
Demos are snippets of code and support files that showcase concepts and ideas related to the lecture.
Demos are located in the `demo/` folder.
Each demo has its own folder with source code, `Makefile` or other build files (if required) and support files.

Lab content consists of lab text and lab activities.
Lab text is placed in the `README.md` file.
Each lab activity has its own folder with source code, `Makefile` or other build files (if required) and support files.
