# Reviewing contributions to Operating Systems OER

These are recommendations when reviewing contributions to the Operating Systems OER.
Contributions will mostly take the form of GitHub pull requests (PRs);
issues and discussions are expected as well.

When reviewing contributions, please be civil and welcoming towards contributors.
Contributions may not be in the best shape initially, but we appreciate time and effort spent in doing this.

Make sure contributions follow the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md): proper formatting, proper wording, proper styling.
See if the contributions fit into the scope of the repository and solve a problem or add value to it.

If a contribution is OK, please approve it.
In case of a reviewed and approved PR, the assignee will then `Rebase and merge` the PR.

If a contribution needs work, please make the appropriate comments.
For a PR use discussion comments, or comments on the code / text, or directly [suggest changes](https://thenextweb.com/news/github-launches-suggested-changes-to-make-it-easier-to-collaborate-within-pull-requests).
