## Question Text

Which of the following is **not** an advantage of software when compared to hardware?

## Question Answers

- reusability

+ performance

- portability

- flexibility

## Feedback

Software is reusable and flexible, unlike physical hardware that's rigid and used-once.
Software is also portable across different hardware (and software platforms).
However, software relies on hardware for running, so software will never beat hardware in terms of sheer speed / performance.
