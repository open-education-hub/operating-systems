## Backstory

- You finish your summer internship
- You explain the cool internal parts of the project to your friends
- They hit you with: "How do I interact with it?"
- You describe the data gathering algorithms again and see them lose interest

What was missing?

### Interactivity

- Software does computation on data and returns data
- The more data we provide to our application, the more relevant its result becomes
