# Sparse File

The `swiss_cheese.sparse` file is a sparse file.
It stores 1 character of useful data followed by 10 bytes of spaces.
Then another characters, then another 10 bytes of spaces, and so on.

Fill in the blanks in `solve.c` to read the characters, concatenate them together and get the flag.
