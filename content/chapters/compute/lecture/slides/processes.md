## Processes

---

### Processes

* A process is a **running program**
  * It is a collection of resources (Memory, CPU, I/O) and abstractions over them (VAS, threads, file descriptors)
* An application can spawn multiple processes
* The OS allows each [thread](./threads.md) to run on a **core** for a few milliseconds (time slice)
* Then the OS pauses the thread and replaces it with another one (context switch)

----

#### What We Want

* Run more apps than cores
* Use resources efficiently:
  * Memory: isolated data
  * CPU: low idle times
  * I/O: responsiveness

#### What We Don't Want

* Unresponsive processes
* Processes monopolizing resources
* System freezes

---

### Process Address Space

* Each process has its own **Virtual Address Space (VAS)**:
  * Isolation
  * The process "thinks" it uses the entire address space

### Process Attributes - from User Space

* PID: numeric identifier
* PPID: parent's PID (one parent per process)
* running time
* threads

```console
student@os:~/.../compute/lecture/demo/create-thread$ python3 create_process.py
[main] PID = 16066; PPID = 7820
[thread] PID = 16066; PPID = 7820
```
