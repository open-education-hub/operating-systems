# Always Shared Sections

## Question Text

The pages of which sections in the process virtual address space are **always** shared between the parent and child process?

## Question Answers

- None, because they are marked copy-on-write

- Kernel pages because there is only one kernel

+ Non-writable sections, such as `.text` or `.rodata`

- `libc` pages, because it is a shared library and all processes refer the same memory

## Feedback

The name of the mechanism is copy-on-**write**.
Pages are only copied when written to.
If you never write data to a page, it will remain shared.
You cannot write data to non-writable pages, such as those in the `.text` or `.rodata` sections.
