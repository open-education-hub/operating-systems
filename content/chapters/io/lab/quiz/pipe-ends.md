## Feedback

Running the binary first tells us which file descriptor is which:

```console
student@os:~/.../lab/support/pipes$ ./anonymous_pipes 
pipedes[0] = 3; pipedes[1] = 4
 * pipe created
 -- Press ENTER to continue ...
```

Then `lsof` gives us the complete answer:

```console
student@os:~/.../lab/support/pipes$ lsof -w -p $(pidof anonymous_pipes)

```

The last 2 lines are the 2 ends of the pipe:
3 and 4.
Note each of these numbers is followed by a letter.
As you might have guessed:

- `r` means "read"
- `w` means "write"
- `u` means both "read" and "write"

Also, the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html) is quite clear on this issue:

> `pipefd[0]` refers to the read end of the pipe.  `pipefd[1]` refers
> to the write end of the pipe.
