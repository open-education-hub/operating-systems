# `mmap()` vs `read()` and `write()` Benchmark

## Question Text

According to the times shown by `benchmark_cp.sh`, which of the two implementations is faster?

## Question Answers

- the one using `mmap()`

- the one using `read()` and `write()`

+ they are roughly equivalent

## Feedback

In our case, running the script a few times results in the following running times:

```console
student@os:/.../support/file-mappings$ ./benchmark_cp.sh 
make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.
Benchmarking mmap_cp on a 1GB file...

real    0m30,597s
user    0m0,569s
sys	0m2,286s

So it seems that using `mmap()` rather than `read()` and `write()` yields about a 15% increase in performance.
However, you might get different results on your system.
This depends on your storage device (SSD vs HDD) and its specific speed (like its RPM for an HDD).
So the more conservative answer is to say that this depends on external aspects and that, in general, the 2 implementations are more or less equivalent.
