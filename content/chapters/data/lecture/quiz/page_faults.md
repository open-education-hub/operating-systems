## Question Text

What entity is responsible for checking the access rights when a memory operation is performed?

## Question Answers

- The memory manangement unit
+ The page fault handler
- The RAM memory
- The processor

## Feedback

The MMU simply checks address mappings, not access rights.
RAM memory is just addressable memory (like the storage unit boxes in our storage unit example).
The processor simply issues the memory request.
