}
void main()
{
    Obj b = quiz(o1, o2);
}
```

## Question Answers

+ constructor calls = 0, copy constructor calls = 3, assignment operator calls = 1, destructor calls = 3

- constructor calls = 1, copy constructor calls = 2, assignment operator calls = 1, destructor calls = 2

- constructor calls = 0, copy constructor calls = 2, assignment operator calls = 1, destructor calls = 2

- constructor calls = 0, copy constructor calls = 3, assignment operator calls = 1, destructor calls = 1

## Feedback

There are no constructor calls because there is no variable that is no object construction by using an `int`.
There are 3 copy constructor calls: for passing `o1`, for passing `o2` and for returning `o2`.
There is 1 assignment operator call for `o2 = o1`.
There are 3 destructor calls, because each constructed object needs to be destroyed.
