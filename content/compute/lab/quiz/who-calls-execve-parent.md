# Who Calls `execve` in the Log of the Parent Process?

## Question Text

Which process calls `execve("sleepy_creator", ["sleepy_creator"], ...)`, that you found in the log of the parent process?

## Question Answers

- The kernel because that's where the loader is located

- The loader because it is the loader who creates new processes

- The C runtime because this is the C interpreter

+ `bash` because we run `sleepy_creator` from terminal, i.e. from `bash`

## Feedback

All processes spawned from the command-line are children of the current `bash` process.
